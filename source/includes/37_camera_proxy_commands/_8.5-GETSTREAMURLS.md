## GET\_STREAM\_URLS

This command is used to obtain URLs for a camera that does not have a constant URL like a Cloud based camera or for cameras that have a wider range of features and configurable options that can produce better customer experiences using various clients. 

A Client will make this request to a driver and provide information about how the client will be using the stream.  The driver optionally can adjust the URL(s) returned based on this information.  Driver developers are encouraged to test their driver on various devices to ensure good customer experiences when viewing collages, high resolution or high frame rate streams.


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
|CODEC| Optional. Comma separated list of codecs that the client can support with the most preferred first.  A driver is not required to handle this but some drivers may want to if they support multiple codecs. (mjpeg, h264, h265)|
|RESOLUTION| Optional. Resolution that the client will be using to display the stream.  A driver is not required to support this but this can be helpful for clients that may need a lower resolution stream for collages of multiple cameras and a 4MP or higher stream would tax the client hardware.|
|FPS| Optional. Frames Per Second that the client would prefer.  A driver is not required to support this but if it does it may result in better customer experience when dealing with collages on Navigators.|


### Examples

An example of the simplest XML returned by a driver is shown to the right:

```xml
<streams>
   <stream url="http://192.168.1.150/view_camera.cgi">
</streams>

or

<streams>
   <stream url="https://192.168.1.150:443/view_camera.cgi" codec="h264">
   <stream url="http://192.168.1.150:80/view_camera_h265.cgi" codec="h265">
</streams>
```


This is followed by an example from a camera with more features and can provide more options to allow clients to pick a better stream:


```xml
<streams>
<stream url="rtsps://server.company.com:554/rtsp.cgi" codec="h265" resolution="1920x1080" fps="60">
<stream url="rtsps://server.company.com:554/cloudapi.cgi?fh2f5hw2" codec="h265" resolution="640x480" fps="5">
<stream url="rtsp://server.company.com:554/cloudapi.cgi?fh2f4hw1" codec="h264" resolution="1920x1080" fps="60">
<stream url="rtsp://server.company.com:554/cloudapi.cgi?fh2f4hw2" codec="h264" resolution="640x480" fps="5">
<stream url="https://server.company.com:443/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhsw3" codec="mjpeg" resolution="1920x1080" fps="20">
<stream url="https://server.company.com:443/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhsw5" codec="mjpeg">
<stream url="http://server.company.com:80/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhw3" codec="mjpeg" resolution="1920x1080" fps="20">
<stream url="http://server.company.com:80/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhw5" codec="mjpeg">
</streams>
```
