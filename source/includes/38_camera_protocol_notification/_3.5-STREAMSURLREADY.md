## STREAM\_URLS\_READY

Notify used for following up to a GET\_STREAM\_URLS Synchronous call.  This Notify will let a UI know that the URL information they requested is ready.  The driver must use the same key parameter value that was returned to the UI as the key parameter in this notify.


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| KEY| Key of the originating call for the snapshot to be created.|
|URLS| String of XML object as described in the description of this call. |


### Examples

An example of the simplest XML used by a driver is shown to the right:

```xml
<streams key="1234">
   <stream url="http://192.168.1.150/view_camera.cgi">
</streams>

or

<streams key="1234" camera_address="192.168.1.150">
   <stream url="https://192.168.1.150:443/view_camera.cgi" codec="h264">
   <stream url="http://192.168.1.150:80/view_camera_h265.cgi" codec="h265">
</streams>
```


This is followed by an example from a camera with more features and can provide more options to allow clients to pick a better stream:

```xml
<streams key="1234" camera_address="server.company.com">
<stream url="rtsps://192.168.1.150:554/rtsp.cgi" codec="h265" resolution"1920x1080" fps="60">
<stream url="rtsps://192.168.1.150:554/cloudapi.cgi?fh2f5hw2" codec="h265" resolution"640x480" fps="5">
<stream url="rtsp://192.168.1.150:554/cloudapi.cgi?fh2f4hw1" codec="h264" resolution"1920x1080" fps="60">
<stream url="rtsp://192.168.1.150:554/cloudapi.cgi?fh2f4hw2" codec="h264" resolution"640x480" fps="5">
<stream url="https://192.168.1.150:443/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhsw3" codec="mjpeg" resolution"1920x1080" fps="20">
<stream url="https://192.168.1.150:443/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhsw5" codec="mjpeg">
<stream url="http://192.168.1.150:80/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhw3" codec="mjpeg" resolution"1920x1080" fps="20">
<stream url="http://192.168.1.150:80/cloudapi.cgi?fh2fhw5" codec="mjpeg">
</streams>

```
